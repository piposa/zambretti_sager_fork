# Configuration

The integration is configured through a **Config Flow** — the setup wizard in the Home Assistant UI.

---

## Initial setup wizard

**Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Zambretti and Sager**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Pressure sensor** | ✅ | Atmospheric pressure sensor (hPa). Supports `device_class: atmospheric_pressure` or `pressure` |
| **Wind direction sensor** | ❌ | Wind direction in degrees. Improves the Sager forecast |
| **Wind speed sensor** | ❌ | Wind speed. Used in the card and sensor attributes |
| **Temperature sensor** | ❌ | Temperature for accurate sea level pressure correction |
| **Humidity sensor** | ❌ | Humidity for precipitation probability calculation |
| **Rain detection sensor** | ❌ | Current rain as `raining`/`none`, `on`/`off`, or `0`/`1`; raises probability while rain is detected |
| **Rain amount sensor** | ❌ | Measured precipitation amount; also raises probability when greater than zero |
| **Location (map)** | ✅ | Weather station coordinates — used for altitude detection |
| **Sea level correction** | ❌ | Enable if your pressure sensor measures absolute (station) pressure |

By default, the map is pre-filled with coordinates from your Home Assistant configuration.

## Sea level pressure correction

Enable this if your sensor measures **absolute** (station) pressure rather than mean sea level pressure (MSLP/QNH).

When enabled, the integration:

1. Fetches **altitude** from the [Open-Elevation API](https://open-elevation.com) using map coordinates
2. Applies the **barometric formula** with temperature compensation (if a temperature sensor is configured):

```
P_sea = P_abs / (1 − (0.0065 × h) / (T + 0.0065 × h + 273.15))^5.257
```

> Altitude is fetched **once** at integration startup. Make sure HA has internet access.

If your sensor already reports sea level pressure (names often include `sea_level`, `mslp`, `qnh`), you can **leave correction disabled**.

---

## Multiple instances

You can add multiple integration instances for different weather stations. Each instance is tied to a **unique pressure sensor**.

---

## Changing settings

**Settings → Devices & Services → Zambretti and Sager → Configure**

You can change:

- Sensors (pressure, wind, temperature, humidity, rain detection, rain amount)
- Map coordinates
- Sea level correction toggle

After changing the pressure sensor, pressure trend history will start accumulating from scratch.

## Integration dependencies

From `manifest.json`:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `recorder` | Pressure history for trend calculation |
| `frontend` | Lovelace card registration |
| `http` | HTTP service for card static files |
| `lovelace` | Dashboard integration |

Make sure **recorder** is enabled and storing states from your pressure sensor.
